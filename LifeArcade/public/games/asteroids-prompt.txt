Create a 2D arcade game titled "Void Drift" inspired by the classic Asteroids, where the player pilots a spacecraft represented by Conway's iconic GLIDER pattern through an infinite void filled with drifting celestial debris. The ship uses realistic inertia-based physics: the player rotates the ship with left/right controls and applies thrust to accelerate in the facing direction, with momentum carrying the ship through space even after thrust is released. The playfield implements full screen-wrap mechanics—objects exiting one edge reappear seamlessly on the opposite side, creating the illusion of a toroidal universe. Asteroids are rendered as authentic Game of Life still-life patterns (LOAF, BEEHIVE, BOAT, BLOCK) in three distinct sizes, each drifting at constant velocity. When destroyed by player projectiles, large asteroids split into two medium fragments, and medium asteroids split into two small fragments, each inheriting modified trajectory vectors to create spreading debris fields. Small asteroids are destroyed completely. The player fires single-cell projectiles that travel at high velocity but have limited lifetime, preventing screen spam. Collision detection uses circular hitboxes for fairness despite the irregular GoL pattern shapes. Scoring rewards smaller asteroids more heavily (100 > 50 > 20 points) to encourage risky close-range combat. Level progression increases asteroid count and can optionally boost their speed. The game ends when the player's GLIDER collides with any asteroid, with a brief invincibility period after each level begins to prevent spawn-kills.
