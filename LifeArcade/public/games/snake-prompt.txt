Create a Snake game called "Trail of Life" where the snake is made entirely of Game of Life patterns.

Core mechanics:
- Each snake segment is an authentic GoL pattern (BLOCK, BEEHIVE, BLINKER, etc.)
- Food items are also GoL patterns - some oscillate (BLINKER, BEACON), some are still lifes
- When the snake eats food, that exact pattern becomes the new tail segment
- This creates a unique visual "trail of life patterns" as the snake grows

Visual requirements:
- Use VideoGradientRenderer for colorful masked gradients
- Portrait orientation 1200×1920 for arcade installation
- 20×32 logical grid (60px cells)
- Google brand colors throughout
- Support day/night theme switching

Gameplay:
- Grid-based discrete movement (classic Snake feel)
- Speed increases with each food eaten
- Growth rate increases every 5 foods (1 → 2 → 3 segments per food)
- Wall collision and self-collision cause game over
- Explosions use Pure GoL patterns for visual effect

The result should feel like Conway's Game of Life came alive as a playable snake.
