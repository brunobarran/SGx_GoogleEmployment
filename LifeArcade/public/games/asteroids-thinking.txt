My approach to "Void Drift" centered on reconciling the <span class="highlight blue">iconic GLIDER pattern</span> with the rotational demands of a spacecraft—a challenge since cellular automata don't naturally support angular transformation. Rather than compromise authenticity with procedural rotation, I chose to leverage p5.js's <span class="highlight green">canvas transformation system</span>, applying rotate() around the ship's center point while keeping the GLIDER pattern frozen in its canonical form. This preserves the mathematical identity of the pattern while achieving smooth visual rotation at 60fps. The <span class="highlight red">inertia physics model</span> required careful tuning: thrust applies force along the ship's facing vector, velocity accumulates with minimal friction (0.998 decay), and a hard speed cap prevents runaway acceleration—this creates the authentic "drifting in space" feel where momentum is king. For the asteroid hierarchy, I mapped Game of Life <span class="highlight yellow">still-life complexity to size tiers</span>: LOAF and POND for large (high cell count, visually imposing), BOAT and TUB for medium, and the humble BLOCK for small. The classic division mechanic introduces <span class="highlight red">trajectory divergence</span>—child asteroids spawn with perpendicular velocity offsets from their parent, creating the expanding debris clouds that force constant repositioning. Screen wrapping was implemented as simple boundary teleportation rather than torus projection, applied uniformly to player, asteroids, and bullets—this includes the critical edge case where bullets can wrap around to hit asteroids on the opposite side. Collision uses <span class="highlight green">circle-circle intersection</span> with hitbox radii scaled to 80% of visual size for asteroids and 60% for the player, ensuring forgiving gameplay without feeling unfair. The invincibility window post-spawn (120 frames) with visual blinking feedback prevents the frustrating "spawn into asteroid" death scenario common in arcade implementations.
