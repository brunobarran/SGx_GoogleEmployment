Implement a Flappy Bird clone where the environment is generated using Game of Life principles.

The player controls a bird that falls due to gravity and flaps upward when spacebar is pressed. The bird must navigate through gaps between pipe pairs.

Pipes are decorated with GoL patterns (blinkers, toads) that animate according to B3/S23 rules, creating visual interest. The gap size and pipe spacing create a challenging rhythm.

Background features multiple parallax layers with GoL still life patterns (blocks, beehives, boats) scrolling at different speeds.

Score increases with each pipe successfully passed. Game ends on collision with pipes or ground. Difficulty increases by narrowing gaps over time.
