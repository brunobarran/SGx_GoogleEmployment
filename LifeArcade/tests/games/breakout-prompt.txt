Create a Breakout/Arkanoid style game where bricks are replaced with Conway's Game of Life patterns.

The player controls a paddle at the bottom that bounces a ball upward. The top portion contains a grid of "bricks" that are actually live cells in a GoL simulation.

When the ball hits a live cell, it destroys that cell, potentially causing chain reactions as the GoL rules apply on each tick. Some patterns (oscillators, still lifes) create interesting destruction cascades.

The paddle and ball physics follow traditional Breakout mechanics. Special "power-up" patterns (pulsars, penta-decathlons) drop when destroyed, granting temporary abilities.

Win condition: Clear all live cells. Lose condition: Ball falls below paddle three times.
