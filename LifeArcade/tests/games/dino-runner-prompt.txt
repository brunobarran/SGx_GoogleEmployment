Design an endless runner game inspired by Chrome's Dino Game, but with a Game of Life twist.

The player character is a simple dino sprite that automatically runs forward. The player can only jump (spacebar) to avoid obstacles.

Obstacles are procedurally generated using Conway's Game of Life patterns - still lifes (blocks, beehives) as ground obstacles and spaceships (gliders, LWSS) as flying obstacles.

The background features parallax layers of GoL still life patterns that scroll at different speeds to create depth. Speed increases gradually over time.

Game ends when the player collides with any obstacle. Score is based on distance traveled and obstacles cleared.
